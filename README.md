# FYP-ZKP
This project is aimed to develop a library, **zkVML**, which provides high-level APIs in Python to validate the inferences running on machine learning model. 

## Introduction to Zero Knowledge Proofs
Zero knowledge proof, is an advanced cryptographic technique that allows the prover to prove any statement without revealing anything about it. This is very useful in privacy preserving systems, where you can proof  the correctness of a statement without revealing any content. 

### Zero Knowledge Proofs in Machine Learning
Zero knowledge proofs have a wide array of usages in context of machine learning model. This library, focuses on validating the model itself and verify that the inference has been run correctly on the model, without revealing the weights of the model.
